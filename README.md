## General Information

The database created for this project contains data for european football (soccer) matches between 2008 and 2015.
The database contains match, team, player, stadium, league, city and country information. The database is initialized and
populated using sql files and uses a command-line interface to access and interact with database. The interface was created
using the Java programming language.

## Running the Program and Populating the Database

1. Before running the program, edit the ```auth.cfg``` file with your username and password to connect to the database server.
2. The program can be run using the command: ```make run```
3. Once the program is running, type ```init``` to populate the database. The population process takes approximately 20 minutes so only do this once.
4. The database is now setup and ready to use!
   
## Scope of Functionality

The database interface implements the following queries:

1. ```init``` - Initialize database
2. ```c <name>``` - Search for a country population

8. ```pa <player ID>``` - Search for player attributes
9. ```s <stadium ID>``` - Search for stadium capacity, city name, country name, built date
10. ```m <match ID>``` - Search for  season, league, date, home score, away score, home team name, away team name
11. ```mt``` - Gives top 5 players that have played for the most teams

19. ```hgd``` - Gives the team with the highest goal differential for each season
20. ```lr``` < country > < year > - Final league standings for country's league. Enter year between 2008 and 2015
21. ```cfn``` - Gives top 20 most common male professional soccer player first names
22. ```cbm``` - Gives percentage of players born in each month ranked from highest to lowest
23. ```ht``` - Gives top 5 heaviest teams
